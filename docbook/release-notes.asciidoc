= Wireshark wireshark-version:[] Release Notes
// AsciiDoc quick reference: http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc

This is a semi-experimental release intended to test new features for Wireshark 2.2.

== What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is the world's most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

=== New and Updated Features

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 2.0.0:
** You can now switch between between Capture and File Format dissection of
the current capture file via the View menu in the Qt GUI.
** You can now show selected packet bytes as ASCII, HTML, Image, ISO 8859-1, Raw or UTF-8.
** You can now use regular expressions in Find Packet.
** Name resolution for packet capture now supports asynchronous DNS lookups only. Therefore the
"concurrent DNS resolution" preference has been deprecated and is a no-op. To enable DNS name
resolution some build dependencies must be present (currently c-ares). If that is not the case DNS
name resolution will be disabled (but other name resolution mechanisms, such as host files,
are still available).
** Highlight hovered byte in Packet Bytes Pane

//=== Removed Dissectors

=== New File Format Decoding Support

Wireshark is able to display the format of some types of files (rather than
displaying the contents of those files). This is useful when you're curious
about, or debugging, a file and its format.  To open a capture file (such as
PCAP) in this mode specify "MIME Files Format" as the file's format in the
Open File dialog.

New files that Wireshark can open in this mode include:

=== Major API Changes

The libwireshark API has undergone some major changes:

* The address macros (e.g., SET_ADDRESS) have been removed.  Use the
(lower case) functions of the same names instead.

* "old style" dissector functions (that don't return number of bytes
used) have been replaced in name with the "new style" dissector
functions.

* tvb_get_string and tvb_get_stringz have been replaced with
tvb_get_string_enc and tvb_get_stringz_enc respectively.


== Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

=== Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You can
usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system
specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be found
on the https://www.wireshark.org/download.html#thirdparty[download page]
on the Wireshark web site.

== File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations vary
from platform to platform. You can use Aboutâ†’Folders to find the default
locations on your system.
